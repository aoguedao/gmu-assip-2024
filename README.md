## Short Biography

*Prof. Padhu Seshaiyer is a Full Professor of Mathematical Sciences and works in the broad areas of Computational Mathematics, Data science, Numerical methods for differential equations, Mathematical Biology, Computational Biomechanics, Design Thinking and STEM Education. In particular, his research includes the development of new analytical techniques and efficient computational algorithms to obtain numerical solutions to mathematical models describing multi-physics interactions with applications to real-world problems. During the last two decades, he has initiated and directed a variety of educational programs including faculty development, post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate research, K-12 outreach, teacher professional development, and enrichment programs to foster the interest of students and teachers at all levels to apply well-developed research concepts, to fundamental applications arising in STEM disciplines. Over the years, he has won several prestigious awards and honors for his contributions to research, teaching and service. In 2019, he was one of the Plenary Speakers for the VI WCDANM conference.
